- Blackboard
  - Persistence
  - Clear blackboard button allowing people to decline the clear if they say so within 10 seconds (like league surrender vote)
  - Undo/redo

```
What's your username?

\> [username]

- Server-sided commands integrated with client-sided ones, command information aggregates server commands & client commands with little UI differentiation
  - Server-sided admin commands
    - Create command command? (write js)
    konami enhanced console


## Architecture

- Perhaps socket payloads must be interfaces due to them being serialized (functions will be lost)
- Command event-sourcing (history)
- Command modularization
