## Welcome to my sandbox!

Here I play around with various web technologies, usually the cutting-edge ones, to experiment with future technologies.

This text was written in Markdown and preloaded via fetch API - then awaited by the `tech-info` command, and parsed using an external Markdown parser.

**Socket.io** is used for the WebSockets integration - this allows for the online count and I'm planning on implementing some weird / cool stuff with it. Currently have a blackboard prototype (try the command `blackboard`)!

The frontend & backend are written in TypeScript in strict mode. The code itself employs some functional programming, with an emphasis on iterability, immutability, and scalability.

Commands are referenced with a `Command` interface, which includes a description, run action, and optional aliases.

This site itself is now open-source - find it on [Github](https://github.com/jamieday/jamieday.ca)! ðŸ¤“
