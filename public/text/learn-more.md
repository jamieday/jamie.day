## My software journey

Here's a short story of my journey with software - from when I first discovered programming, to what I do with it now.

### HTML / JavaScript

I've been building websites since I was seven or eight years old. At first, I didn't know what I was doing, but soon I learned how to navigate basic HTML & JavaScript, enabling me to build spaces where I could share what I loved. I shared music I liked, video games I'd recommend, and interesting tools I'd found.

### Macromedia Flash MX

One day at school when recess was about to begin, I caught some of the older kids sneaking into the library. I followed them, only to find them crowding around the library computer excitedly talking about guns and explosions and other forbidden things.

Turns out they were building animations with an application called Macromedia Flash MX. I asked how it worked, and they showed me how to make cool animations. Naturally, after school I then pirated the software and installed it on my mom's computer (sorry Macromedia). And after playing with it myself, I went on to discover something nobody at school had - ActionScript 2 (the scripting language for Flash). With my JavaScript experience, ActionScript wasn't terribly unfamiliar to me, so I found a way to do something nobody else could - make interactive stories with secret story arcs. Cool!

### Java

Soon after this, I started making games. It was a bit hard for me at first. Researching more, I learned about Java, and it seemed more interesting than Flash so I decided to pirate some tutorials to learn how to work the thing. After many side-quests through double-buffering and 2D game physics, I eventually learned how to invent my own games, and hacked others' games, including the Java-based games RuneScape and Minecraft.

I remember in seventh grade that I was envious of kids who had iPhones and could play a game called DoodleJump. So I began work on my own DoodleJump. I customized my game, SkyJump, with things I thought DoodleJump missed - rising lava for one thing, and a serene sky that became a starry night as you climbed higher, and unlockable abilities that allowed you to play in slo-mo for a short while or even fly.

I made an RPG game that had auto-walking, but I struggled with the trigonometry because I hadn't learned any of that yet in school. I made a snake game that had a built-in AI which could make an incredibly long snake if you let it go on at 100x speed. And I made a chatbot that would certainly not pass the turing test, but nonetheless had some funny things to say.

I was in awe at what one could do with some basic math & logic. And networking! Creating connected, multiplayer online experiences was like magic. But with minimal funds to pay for a VPS, I couldn't build much of that. I remember my dad's skeptical look as I pleaded with him to give me access to the router so I could forward a few ports.

The one thing I remember most strongly is the dream I had as a kid - that one day I would master the art of programming and be able to create anything I could imagine.

### Web Apps

In 2016, my older brother called me as he was developing some software and wanted me to check it out, possibly even work with him as an intern.

It was a web app, which is something I had little experience with. But I decided to jump in, and working on the project brought me back to my roots; back to my old friends HTML & JavaScript. I learned some new skills too - PHP, C#, SQL, design patterns. As the startup grew, I had to learn even more things, including customer support, product management, UX, a touch of marketing, or even just how to work on a team. Most of all I learned that startups can be kinda crazy.

In this time I created a number of side-projects, including this website, a tetris game made in F#, two music sharing apps, a hospital management system, a homemade food marketplace, and a special cryptocurrency that now has thousands of owners.

Building side-projects, going to conferences, and working on challenging problems has made the past six years at ScalePad a period of extreme growth for me. Most fundamentally, at ScalePad I discovered a new purpose for my passions. The dream I had as a child morphed as I matured, and I no longer cared to one day create whatever I wanted. Instead, I aspired to create what _the customer_ wanted - a much more fulfilling (and challenging) mission to be sure.
