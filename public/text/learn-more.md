## My software journey

Here's a short story of my journey with software - from when I first discovered programming, to what I do with it now.

### Websites

I've been building websites since I was seven or eight years old. At first, I didn't know what I was doing, but soon I learned how to navigate basic HTML & JavaScript, enabling me to build spaces where I could share what I loved. I shared music I liked, video games I'd recommend, and interesting tools I'd found.

### Animated Stories

One day at school when recess was about to begin, I caught some of the older kids sneaking into the library. I followed them, only to find them crowding around the library computer excitedly talking about guns and explosions and other forbidden things.

Turns out they were building animations with an application called Macromedia Flash MX. I asked how it worked, and they showed me how to make cool animations. Naturally, after school I then pirated the software and installed it on my mom's computer. And after playing with it myself, I went on to discover something nobody at school had - ActionScript 2 (the scripting language for Flash). With my JavaScript experience, ActionScript wasn't terribly unfamiliar to me, so I found a way to do something nobody else could - make interactive stories with secret story arcs. Cool!

### Video Games

Soon after this, I started making games. It was a bit hard for me at first. Researching more, I learned about Java, and it seemed more interesting than Flash so I decided to pirate some tutorials to learn how to work the thing. After many side-quests through double-buffering and 2D game physics, I eventually learned how to invent my own games, and hacked others' games, including the Java-based games RuneScape and Minecraft.

I remember in seventh grade that I was envious of kids who had iPhones and could play a game called DoodleJump. So I began work on my own DoodleJump. I customized my game, SkyJump, with things I thought DoodleJump missed - rising lava for one thing, and a serene sky that became a starry night as you climbed higher, and unlockable abilities that allowed you to play in slo-mo for a short while or even fly.

I made an RPG game that had auto-walking, but I struggled with the trigonometry because I hadn't learned any of that yet in school. I made a snake game that had a built-in AI which could make an incredibly long snake if you let it go on at 100x speed. And I made a chatbot that would certainly not pass the turing test, but nonetheless had some funny things to say.

I was in awe at the magic one could create with some basic math & logic.

Above all, what I remember most strongly is this dream I had - that I would master the art of programming and be able to create anything I could imagine.

### ScalePad

In 2016, my brother called me as he was building a B2B software company called Warranty Master (now ScalePad).

I joined him, and I fell in love with the business and the startup environment. There was no structure, no process, no office even, and everybody was completely hands-on - it was absolute chaos, held together only by a strong focus on building exceptional software for customers. I felt very blessed that my hobby could become my work.

And then we grew, building the necessary structures, processes, we got an office, product management, customer success, HR, finance, legal, marketing, sales. There were tons of challenges and puzzles to go through to make growth work. Most importantly it's not easy to scale passion - there are plenty of distractions in growth, so we struggled to find our balance and remember our roots.

It was painful for everyone to find a path out of the startup stage, and I think it was pure stubbornness that allowed us to make it through that transition. Thankfully, we're on an upwards path now, and we're ready for the challenges ahead.

I still built some side-projects in my spare time, including a few games, a couple music sharing apps, a hospital management system, a homemade food marketplace, and a special cryptocurrency that was distributed to thousands of people.

Building side-projects, going to conferences, and working on challenging problems has made the past six years at ScalePad a period of extreme growth for me. Most fundamentally, at ScalePad I discovered a new purpose for my passions. I gave up on my dream to create whatever I wanted. Instead, I aspired to create what _the customer_ wanted - a much more fulfilling (and challenging) mission to be sure.
